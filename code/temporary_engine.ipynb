    "The advent of podcasts started in late 2004 with the public's greater accesibility to broadband Internet and portable digital audio playback devices such as the iPod. This allowed people to explore the digital media space by developing episodic series of spoken word through digital audio files that could be downloaded onto your personal device for easy listening. Discussion and content within a podcast can range from carefully scripted to totally improvised. Podcasts combine elaborate and artistic sound production with thematic concerns ranging from scientific research to slice-of-life journalism. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "However in recent years, podcasting has become a disruptive and popular medium to invest in and use as a commercial platform. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the podcast wars intensifies, major players such as Spotify, Apple's iTunes, Pandora and iHeartRadio are rushing to claim dominance within the media space. And one of the ways that has proven to much success in establishing that dominant position is by developing a reliable and accurate recommendation system for their podcast service platforms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to build a recommendation system based on the podcast descriptors and categories as driving features for our model to create those recommendations. We have managed to sourced a dataset with over ~1 million + rows of podcast data from Listen Notes, a podcast search engine. Making it one of the most comprehensive podcast databases that you can find on the Internet. \n",
    "\n",
    "This recommendation system will then be onboarded onto a front facing website interface that users can interact with by hosting our application on Heroku. "
